# Two Largest Elements

This was an algorithmic problem first discussed in [ADSP Episode 72: C++ Algorithm Family Feud!](https://adspthepodcast.com/2022/04/08/Episode-72.html). Then Tyler Weaving did some [initial profiling that he shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/squirrel428_/status/1516056776004800515) which then [Conor responded to](https://twitter.com/adspthepodcast/status/1516097211762888710?s=20&t=7CLPpFoMnDwta3U4eDj3QA). Conor later wrote some initial and most likely totally **incorrect** profiling code that yielded the graph below. This repo will set up some benchmarks that profile these algorithms correctly.
